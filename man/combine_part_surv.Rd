\usage{
combine_part_surv(fit_matrix, ..., subset)

combine_part_surv_(fit_matrix, choices, subset)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit_matrix}{a list.   See details.}

\item{...}{additional named arguments when using \code{combine_part_surv};
see below.}

\item{subset}{the subset of data for which you want fits}

\item{choices}{a list specifying which fits to use; see below.}
}
\value{
a list of partitioned survival objects
}
\description{
recombine elements from different part_surv ojects
}
\details{
\code{fit_matrix} is a list, with each element corresponding to a subset
of the data that was fit.
Each element contains amatrix of partitioned survival
(\code{part_surv}) objects, generally
from \code{partitioned_survival_from_tabular}.
Each row corresponding to a distribution and each column
to a group or condition for which a partitioned survival object
was created.
The \code{choices} argument in \code{choose_part_surv_} and the
\code{...} argument in \code{choose_part_surv} specify which elements of which fit
survival objects to combine.
\code{choices} is a list, where the name of each element should be the name of
one of the strategies.   Each of those elements should be a list with elements
named pfs and os, for
the two elements of a partial survival object, and each element
must be a distribution type (a distribution used in the survival
fit).   Each name should be one of the groups
or subgroups; that is, a column name of \code{fit_matrix}.
