{"name":"heemod","tagline":"Models for Health Economic Evaluation","body":"# heemod - Health Ecomomic Evaluation MODelling\r\n\r\n`heemod` is an `R` toolset for health ecomomic evaluation modelling. It aims to provide a simple and consistent interface for Markov models specification and comparison. Non-homogenous Markov models (with time varying properties) are supported.\r\n\r\nMost of the analyses presented in [Decision Modelling for Health Economic Evaluation](http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198526629.do) can be performed with `heemod`.\r\n\r\nThis package is still a *beta* version.\r\n\r\nYou can install:\r\n\r\n  * the latest released version from CRAN with:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ninstall.packages(\"heemod\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * the latest development version from github with:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"pierucci/heemod\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Main features\r\n\r\n  * Time-varying transition probabilities.\r\n  * Time-varying values attached to states.\r\n  * Heterogeneity analysis.\r\n  * Probabilistic incertitude analysis.\r\n\r\n## Learning heemod\r\n\r\nTo get started read the [intro vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/introduction.html) (or `vignette(\"introduction\", package = \"heemod\")`).\r\n\r\nSpecific analysis examples (mostly inspired from Decision Modelling for Health Economic Evaluation) can be found in the following vignettes:\r\n\r\n  * [Homogenous Markov model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/homogenous.html) (or `vignette(\"homogenous\", package = \"heemod\")`).\r\n  * [Non-homogenous Markov model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/non-homogenous.html) (or `vignette(\"non-homogenous\", package = \"heemod\")`).\r\n  * Probabilistic incertitude analysis in `vignette(\"probabilistic\", package = \"heemod\")`.\r\n\r\n## Future developments\r\n\r\nIn version 1.0.0 :\r\n\r\n  * Deterministic sensitivity analysis.\r\n  * Graphical analysis of Markov models.\r\n  * Multiple state membership correction methods.\r\n\r\nUpcoming vignettes:\r\n\r\n  * Heterogeneity analysis in `vignette(\"heterogeneity\", package = \"heemod\")`.\r\n  * Model comparison in `vignette(\"comparison\", package = \"heemod\")`.\r\n  * Deterministic sensitivity analysis in `vignette(\"sensitivity\", package = \"heemod\")`.\r\n\r\n## Devs\r\n\r\n[Kevin Zarca](http://www.urc-eco.fr/Kevin-ZARCA,402) and [Antoine FilipoviÄ‡-Pierucci](https://pierucci.github.io/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
